== Description ==
RSVP ME is a simple yet powerful Wordpress plugin that allows you to create events that your site visitors can RSVP to via the event's page or thorough a calendar widget. 

= Features =
* RSVP Event Calendar widget (single event for that day opens in a clean lightbox overlay)
* RSVP Events are Native Custom Post types, so they're in the Wordpress Ecosystem
* Specify Venue, address, date, etc.
* Reservers can send an additional message with their response
* Supports multiple events in a single day
* Events are searchable
* Permalinks are supported so http://yoursite.com/events/my-special-event takes you to the single RSVP event page (Permalinks must be properly setup)
* RSVP submissions are done with ajax
* A very nifty calendary widget styler
